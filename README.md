# Digital-Device-Design-for-Power-Factor-Calculation
The power factor ($PF$) is one of the parameters related to power quality whose inadequate values cause: increasing internal power losses and voltage drops in the facility; reduction of usable capacity of transformers and engines; heated drivers; among others. Aiming for an application in the power quality area, this study proposes the development of a device capable of measuring $PF$ of linear and nonlinear circuits (particularly single-phase rectifiers with resistive loads). The prototype will consist of a microcontroller, a Hall effect sensor to measure current and a circuit for conditioning the voltage and current signals. The embedded software developed for the system is responsible for sampling the involved quantities and, through numerical methods, calculate $PF$ and make it accessible to the user on an interface. The operation of meter is compared with simulation data.
